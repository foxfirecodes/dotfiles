# dotfiles

> My personal dotfiles for \*nix.

This includes all of my dotfiles I use on all my \*nix systems (including but not limited to: Ubuntu, Arch, Pop!\_OS, macOS, WSL).

_Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that some of these scripts / configs are things that I made years ago and have yet to update with all of my new scripting knowledge. Additionally, not everything will work on everyone's system, although I am trying to make these scripts as portable as possible (since I want to be able to automatically deploy my scripts to new machines in the future!)._

## Software

- **Multiplexer:** tmux
- **Editor:** neovim
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / WebStorm

## Setup

In order to set up all these config files for yourself, simply clone the repository and run the `setup.sh` script. Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rayzr522/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
# if you're not on linux or don't want to install system dependencies, skip this:
./scripts/install-system-deps.sh
./setup.sh
```

_Note: running `./setup.sh` with the `-f` flag will cause it to blindly overwrite existing config files without prompting. Only do so if you know what you are doing._

## Other Personal Scripts

These are other personal scripts / tools that I made which I use in conjunction with the config files that are here.
